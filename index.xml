Static content generation To create the blog, I wanted an easy and lightweight solution to setup and deploy. For this reason, I renounced to use a content management system (CMS), such as Joomla or Wordpress, and I have chosen hugo, an open-source static site generator.
For the user interface (UI), the blog is using the Coder theme. The theme is responsive and offers a light or a dark appearance.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://smrtnt.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smrtnt.github.io/about/</guid><description>About me My name is Sam and I am living in the french part of Switzerland.
